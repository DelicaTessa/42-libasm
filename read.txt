An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm,
is a low-level programminglanguage for a computer, or other programmable device, 
in which there is a very strong(but often not one-to-one) correspondence between 
the language and the architectureâ€™smachine code instructions. 
Each assembly language is specific to a particular computerarchitecture. 
In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portableacross multiple architectures 
but require interpreting or compiling. 
Assembly languagem ay also be called symbolic machine code,
